        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn 
        and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a 
        specialized form of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers 
        to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.
        
        Key concepts include:
        - Supervised Learning: Training with labeled data
        - Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
        - Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and feedback
        - Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by biological neurons
        - Natural Language Processing: Enabling computers to understand human language
        
        Vector databases play a crucial role in modern AI applications by enabling 
        semantic search through high-dimensional vector representations of data.
